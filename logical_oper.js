//* Logical Operators
//We have 4 logical operators with us. $and , $or, $nor and $not
// syntax: { operator:  [{condition1},{condition2},â€¦] }

//? 1: $and: Performs a logical AND operation on an array of expressions, where all expressions must be true for the document to match.

//! Find products with price greater than 100 and name equal to "Diamond Ring"

// db.products.find({ $and: [ { 'price': { $gt: 10 } }, { 'name': 'Notebook Collection'} ] })

// db.products.find({'price': {$gt:10}, 'name':{$eq: 'Notebook Collection'}})

//* In MongoDB, when you provide multiple fields within a single query document, MongoDB treats them as an implicit AND operation.

//? 2: $or: Performs a logical OR operation on an array of expressions, where at least one expression must be true for the document to match.

// We can use logical operator only when we have the duplicate fields
// db.products.find({'price': 129, 'price':39})
// but we can write the same in $or operator
// db.products.find({ $or: [{ price: 129 }, { price: 39 }] });

//? 3: $not: Performs a logical NOT operation on the specified expression, inverting the result.
//? Find products with price not equal to 100
// db.products.find( {'price': {$not: {$eq: 100}} } )

//?4: $nor: Performs a logical NOR operation on an array of expressions, where none of the expressions must be true for the document to match
//* Find products with price not equal to 100 or name not equal to "Notebook Collection"
// db.products.find( {$nor: [ {'price': {$eq: 100}}, {'name':'Notebook Collection'} ]} )
